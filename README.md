Thesis for my master thesis: Interpretability-based Model Ensembling Strategies for Medical Image Classification Models

### **Summary of Best Practices - To keep in mind**
✅ Use **Git submodules** for full repositories.  
✅ Use a **third_party/** directory for standalone scripts.  
✅ Use **wrapper functions** instead of modifying external code.  
✅ Automate **setup with scripts** (`setup.sh`).  
✅ Keep **dependencies managed** via `requirements.txt` or `pip install -e .`.  
✅ **Document usage and modifications** in `README.md` & `MODIFICATIONS.md`.
